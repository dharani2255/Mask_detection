## Face-Mask-Detector
* This is a neural network based (mobile net) model which classifies faces based on the presence of the mask
* For this more than 3000 images of masked and unmasked people are used
* Here I have used Mobile net because it is light weight which can be trained on the lower end machines by giving reasonably good accuracy
